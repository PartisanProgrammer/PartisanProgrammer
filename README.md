# My Guiding Philosophies 
#### These are a few of my core focus areas when programming is concerned

## Communication:
Communication is one of if not the most important skills out there, most definetly for group projects, but even for solo projects it's important to be able to get your idea across to the player in a nice way. I do my best to focus heavily on communication, even if I otherwise am introverted because it's so incredibly important that you make sure your team are all on the same page to prevent unneccessary conflicts, duplicate work or getting something you didnt need. I try to not only focus on my own communication during group projects but I also try and help my teammates by asking a lot of questions and making sure everyone feels like they agree on things and they are not left behind. And also to make sure that people who might turn to me for decisions actually goes to the person who is meant to take that decisions so not to overstep any boundries.

## There is always a better way, never settle:
I never stop trying to improve my coding skills and always am on the lookout for new and better ways of doing things I've done before, and for things I have not yet done.

## Don't limit yourself:
I always try to see if theres new or different ways of using tools and not limit myself to "commonly used like". An example would be Unity's Scriptable Objects where they are commonly used as easy data storage but why stop there when there's so much more you can do with them.

## Share your knowledge:
I love sharing new things I learn and am always excited to explain show and explain new things i've discovered. It both helps those around me grow, but it also makes it more likely for them to return the favor and share knowledge they've acquired with me. And honestly it's just fun to share my excitement with others.

## Plan
I personally find planning to be very important, I tend to favor a methodical well thoughtout coding style, which yes, might take longer to set up compared to just start coding and solve issues that arrise, but I find that building solid foundations and really planning for how a project will develop ends up in an end product which is cleaner, more easily expanded upon and an overall greater product.

## Structure
Structuring projects never was my strongest side at the start of my education, with scripts and objects here and there and no general structure to things. It has however become very important to me after seeing a teammate reorganizing the folder structure of a whole project, it went from extremly hard to find things to super easy. Seeing my teammate doing this and the benefits from it really effected me positively. Ever since then I've done my best to keep trying to improve my structure, both when planning projects, such as having color coded Trello boards, but also having structured meetings and projects.

## Have fun!
I love programming, but it's important to make sure it does not become a chore so not to lose the passion for it that I'm lucky to have gotten. Spice things up, try new things, never stop challenging yourself and doing actual work can be the same as having fun
